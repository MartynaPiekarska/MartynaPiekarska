### I'm Martyna Piekarska, Junior Automation Tester at Zoovu üíª

The most important for me is keeping the best quality. I learn and experience the product to find ways in which it doesn't work. Then I talk to you about these issues so that you can make more informed decisions about the quality of your products.

I'm not a tester who likes "break things" - it sounds as testers don't respect developers' work. Devs and testers should play on the same team, reach common goals and enjoy mutual success. Me + devs = ‚ù§Ô∏è
